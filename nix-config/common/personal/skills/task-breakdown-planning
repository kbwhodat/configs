name: task-breakdown-planning
description: Break work into shippable chunks with clear acceptance criteria and minimal blockers

# Purpose
Convert vague goals into executable steps that finish on time.

# When to use
Use this skill when:
- Starting a feature
- You feel stuck or overwhelmed
- Planning a milestone or release
- You need to estimate scope

# Inputs
- Goal statement
- Deadline (if any)
- Existing codebase context (if available)
- Constraints: tech stack, backend readiness, team size

# Output Format (required)
1) Goal re-statement (one sentence)
2) Definition of Done (acceptance criteria)
3) MVP slice (smallest shippable)
4) Task breakdown (ordered steps)
5) Risks/unknowns + how to de-risk
6) Timeboxing suggestion (optional)

# Rules
- Always start with MVP slice
- Each task should be independently testable
- Prefer vertical slices (UI + logic + data) over horizontal layers
- Call out dependencies explicitly
- Avoid tasks longer than one work session; split them

# Acceptance Criteria Template
- User action:
- Expected outcome:
- Error handling:
- Performance/UX bar:
- Test coverage:

# De-risking Playbook
- Unknown API: mock interface first
- Unknown UI: build static screen first
- Unknown data model: draft minimal schema and validate with one flow
- Unknown performance: add measurement early

# What NOT to do
- Don’t plan “perfect architecture” first
- Don’t include optional nice-to-haves in MVP
- Don’t leave tasks vague (“implement backend”); specify endpoints/data
