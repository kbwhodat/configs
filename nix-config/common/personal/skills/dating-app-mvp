description: Build a dating app MVP in Flutter with clean flows, minimal scope, and safety basics

# Purpose
Ship a usable dating app MVP quickly while keeping scope under control.

# When to use
Use this skill when implementing any dating-app feature:
profiles, swiping, matches, messaging, reporting, onboarding.

# MVP Scope (must follow)
MVP includes:
- Auth: email/OTP (or simple email+password) + basic profile creation
- Profile: photos (local mock or simple upload), bio, age, gender, location (optional)
- Discovery: swipe deck (like/pass) with minimal filters
- Match: mutual like creates a match record
- Chat: 1:1 messaging for matched users only (text only)
- Safety: block + report (simple reason list)

Not in MVP unless requested:
- subscriptions, boosts, super likes, read receipts
- video, voice, stories, live location
- complex ML ranking, advanced recommendations
- complicated verification/KYC

# Data Model (baseline)
Entities:
- User(id, createdAt, lastActiveAt)
- Profile(userId, name, age, bio, photos[], gender, preferences, location?)
- Swipe(fromUserId, toUserId, decision, createdAt)
- Match(id, userA, userB, createdAt)
- Message(id, matchId, fromUserId, text, createdAt, deliveredAt?, readAt?)
- Block(blockerId, blockedId, createdAt)
- Report(reporterId, reportedId, reason, details?, createdAt)

Rules:
- Chat only if match exists and neither user blocked the other
- A match is created only on mutual "like"
- Block removes user from discovery and prevents chat immediately

# UI Flows (must be consistent)
1) Onboarding -> Create Profile -> Discovery (Swipe)
2) Discovery -> Match Screen (on match)
3) Matches list -> Chat thread
4) Profile view -> Report / Block actions

# Implementation Rules
- Implement happy-path first, then edge cases
- Use mock repository interfaces first if backend is not ready
- Keep UI responsive and polished (Material 3, spacing grid)
- Never store secrets in the client
- Keep safety actions (block/report) reachable from profile and chat

# Output Expectations
- Provide code that fits the existing app architecture skill
- Be explicit about what is mocked vs real backend
- Prefer simple, shippable implementations
