description: Visual design system and UI rules for polished Flutter apps

# Purpose
Ensure the app looks modern, consistent, and visually appealing.

# When to use
Use this skill whenever generating screens, widgets, or layouts.

# Design System
- Material 3
- Single global ThemeData
- 8pt spacing grid only
- Rounded corners: 12–16dp
- Elevation used sparingly
- Consistent typography scale

# UI Rules
- Prefer composition over custom painting
- Use AnimatedContainer / AnimatedSwitcher for transitions
- No visual clutter: whitespace is intentional
- Buttons and cards must follow the same style everywhere

# Widget Guidelines
- Prefer const constructors
- Extract reusable widgets early
- Avoid deeply nested layouts
- Use LayoutBuilder for responsiveness

# Output Expectations
- UI must look intentional, not demo-like
- Reuse existing components instead of creating new ones
- Favor clarity over cleverness
