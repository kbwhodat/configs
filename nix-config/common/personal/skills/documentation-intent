description: Write concise, high-signal documentation explaining intent, decisions, and usage

# Purpose
Leave future-you (and teammates) enough context to maintain code without re-deriving intent.

# When to use
Use this skill when:
- Adding non-obvious logic
- Introducing a new module/service
- Adding configuration
- Making tradeoffs (performance, security, UX)
- Creating public APIs or reusable components

# Inputs
- Code/diff and what it accomplishes
- Any constraints, tradeoffs, or decisions made

# Output Format (required)
1) One-paragraph overview
2) Key decisions (and why)
3) How to use (quick start)
4) Gotchas / non-obvious behaviors
5) Extension points / future improvements (optional)

# Documentation Rules
- Prefer “why” over “what” (code shows what)
- Use concrete examples
- Avoid long walls of text
- Keep docs close to code: README for modules, doc comments for APIs
- Document invariants and contracts explicitly

# Where to Document
- Public functions/classes: doc comments with inputs/outputs/failures
- Feature modules: README.md with flows and boundaries
- Config: inline comments + example config snippet
- Complex algorithms: short design note with assumptions and complexity

# Required Content for Non-Obvious Logic
- What problem is being solved
- Constraints (latency, memory, UX)
- Invariants (must always be true)
- Failure modes and how they surface

# What NOT to do
- Don’t restate obvious code line-by-line
- Don’t add docs that will drift; keep them minimal and essential
